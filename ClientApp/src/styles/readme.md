# A Guide to the Styling of this App
*Please read me!*

## Quick Start
This app uses [BEM](http://getbem.com/) and [sass](https://sass-lang.com/) to make the code as modular as possible.
I recommend reading up on these if you are unfamiliar.

1.BEM
BEM stands for Block Element Modifier. It's a simple way to organize your styles.
The naming convention follows this pattern:
`.block {}`
`.block__element {}`
`.block--modifier {}`
